## Installation

### (Step 0.1) Install Ruby
If you don't already have it, check out RVM (https://rvm.io/)

### (Step 1) Install Bundler
Bundler is a handy tool to help keep track of the necessary Ruby packages

	gem install bundler
	bundle install

What did I justt install?!?!? Basically just SASS (http://sass-lang.com/), and a few plugins for it(Compass ((http://compass-style.org/)), Susy (http://susy.oddbird.net/), and rgbapng (https://github.com/aaronrussell/compass-rgbapng))

### (Step 1.1) Install Node
If you don't already have Node (http://nodejs.org/), you have to check it out! Seriosuly, if you don't this just won't work. 

### (Step 2) Install Grunt
Grunt (http://gruntjs.com/) is a fun Node tool that manages the project, refreshes dynamically, and tells us when were being extra sexy (ok, that might just be in my head... but I am right?)
	npm install -g grunt-cli
	npm install

### (Step 4) Install eveyrthing else
Run the site (finally!)
	grunt
